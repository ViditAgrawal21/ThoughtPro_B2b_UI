RECOMMENDATIONS:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Fix failed API endpoints before production deployment
• Implement authentication to test protected endpoints
• Ensure UI server is running (npm start) for complete testing
• Verify API server is accessible and responding correctly
• Check authentication flow for protected endpoints
• Validate data models match API documentation
