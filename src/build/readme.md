# Build Instructions for Vercel Deployment

This directory contains the production build files for deployment on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## How to Deploy

1. **Build the Project**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This will generate the optimized files in the `build` directory.

2. **Deploy to Vercel**
    - Push your code to your Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).
    - Import your project into Vercel.
    - Vercel will automatically detect the build output and deploy your site.

## Configuration

- **Output Directory:**  
  Set the output directory to `build` in your Vercel project settings.

- **Environment Variables:**  
  Add any required environment variables in the Vercel dashboard.
