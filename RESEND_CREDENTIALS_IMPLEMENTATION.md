# Resend Employee Credentials Implementation

## Overview
Added functionality for company owners to resend employee login credentials via email. This feature allows owners to easily send credentials to employees who may have forgotten or lost their login information.

## API Endpoint
- **URL**: `https://thoughtprob2b.thoughthealer.org/api/v1/companies/{company_id}/employees/{employee_id}/resend-credentials`
- **Method**: POST
- **Authentication**: Bearer Token (company login token)

### Request Body
```json
{
  "personalEmail": "employee@example.com"
}
```

### Response (Success - 200)
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Employee credentials resent successfully",
  "data": {
    "success": true,
    "message": "Credentials resent successfully"
  }
}
```

### Response (Error - 404)
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Employee not found"
}
```

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. Service Layer (`employeeService.js`)
Added `resendEmployeeCredentials` method that:
- Takes company ID, employee ID, and personal email as parameters
- Sends POST request with proper authentication headers
- Handles various error scenarios with specific error codes
- Provides context-aware error messages

### 2. UI Component (`EmployeeList.jsx`)
Enhanced employee list with:
- **New Resend Button**: Added between Edit and Delete buttons
- **Loading States**: Button shows spinning icon during API call
- **Success Feedback**: Green checkmark appears for 3 seconds after successful resend
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages displayed in banner
- **Personal Email Validation**: Ensures personal email exists before attempting resend

### 3. Styling (`EmployeeList.css`)
Added comprehensive styling for resend button:
- **Green Theme**: Uses green color (#10b981) to indicate send action
- **Loading Animation**: Spinning icon during API call
- **Success State**: Green background with scale animation
- **Hover Effects**: Subtle background color and border changes
- **Disabled State**: Proper opacity and cursor changes

### 4. Error Handling (`errorUtils.js`)
Extended error utility with resend credentials context:
- **Invalid Email**: "Invalid email address. Please verify the employee email and try again."
- **Employee Not Found**: "Employee not found. Please refresh the page and try again."
- **General**: "Unable to resend credentials. Please try again or contact support."

## User Experience Flow

1. **Owner Login**: Company owner logs into the system
2. **Navigate to Employees**: Go to employee management page
3. **View Employee List**: See all employees with personal email addresses
4. **Click Resend Button**: Click the green send icon for specific employee
5. **Loading State**: Button shows spinning icon with "loading" appearance
6. **Success Feedback**: Button briefly shows green checkmark on success
7. **Error Handling**: Any errors displayed in user-friendly banner at top

## Features

### ✅ **Visual Feedback**
- Loading spinner during API call
- Success checkmark animation
- Error banner with dismiss functionality
- Disabled state during processing

### ✅ **Validation**
- Checks for personal email before attempting resend
- Validates company ID and employee ID
- Proper error handling for missing data

### ✅ **Accessibility**
- Proper button titles/tooltips
- Disabled state management
- Clear visual indicators for different states

### ✅ **Error Recovery**
- User-friendly error messages
- Automatic error dismissal
- Retry capability built-in

## Testing Results

### API Test (Successful)
```
Using employee: Jane Smith (ID: 1e30e833-cf0c-47d6-9daa-86f906ab769d)
Personal email: janesmith@gmail.com
Status Code: 200
Response: {
  "success": true,
  "message": "Employee credentials resent successfully",
  "data": {
    "success": true,
    "message": "Credentials resent successfully"
  }
}
```

### Frontend Integration
- ✅ Button appears in employee action bar
- ✅ Loading states work correctly
- ✅ Success animations display properly
- ✅ Error handling shows user-friendly messages
- ✅ Personal email validation prevents invalid requests

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication Required**: Only authenticated company owners can resend credentials
2. **Company Scope**: Can only resend credentials for employees in their own company
3. **Email Validation**: Requires valid personal email address
4. **Error Information**: Doesn't expose sensitive system details in error messages

## Future Enhancements

1. **Confirmation Modal**: Add confirmation dialog before resending
2. **Resend History**: Track when credentials were last resent
3. **Bulk Resend**: Allow resending credentials to multiple employees
4. **Custom Message**: Allow owners to include a custom message with credentials
5. **Email Template**: Customize the email template for credential resends

## Integration Notes

- Uses existing authentication system (JWT tokens)
- Leverages current employee management infrastructure  
- Follows established error handling patterns
- Maintains consistent UI/UX with existing buttons
- Compatible with existing employee data structure
